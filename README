## Registers

### 8-bit

8080 offers the following 8-bit registers: A (primary accumulator), B, C, D, E, H, L

And also, an 8-bit flag register (F), with the following bits:
- 7th bit: S - Sign Flag
- 6th bit: Z - Zero Flag
- 5th bit: 0 - Not used, always zero
- 4th bit: A - Auxiliary Carry Flag (AC)
- 3rd bit: 0 - Not used, always zero
- 2nd bit: P - Parity Flag
- 1st bit: 1 - Not used, always one
- 0th bit: C - Carry Flag

### 16-bit

The previously mentioned 8-bit registers can be used as pairs, yielding in a 16-bit sized registers: BC (B), DE (D), HL (H)

Stack Pointer (SP) register - mantains a pointer to the top of the memory stack

Porgram Counter (PC) register - pointer to the next instruction to be fetched

The register pair consisting of the A and F register is also reffered to as PSW
